Phase One:

    Program: system_info
    Author: Ryan Redman
    Language: Go
    commit: 78cdf4024b45d2f902baba72b47be83905a7e210

    This Go program reads a list of strings, describing proc device files, from a slice.
    Each file is read (via an os call to cat), and the output is then parsed into an
    associative array. This array is then marshalled into JSON and presented on a server, 
    listening on port 1404, at endpoints matching the proc filename.

    Additionally, the root directory of the server presents a generated HTML list of links
    to the various endpoints.

    Configured endpoints include:
        - cpuinfo
        - meminfo
        - uptime
