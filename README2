Phase 2:

    Vagrant file (now old/Vagrantfile.old) executes a script which checks for and, when nessecary, installs git.
    The script then pulls the repo for the system_info Go from Github. It then executes the install-api-env.sh
    script contained in the repo, or will launch the system_info server in the background.

    The install-api-env.sh script verifies/performs and installation of the base golang tools via apt-get.
    It then compiles the system_info server application, and runs the process in the background.
